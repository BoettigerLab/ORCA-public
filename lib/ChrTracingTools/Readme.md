# ChrTracingLib

## About
Welcome. This is a development repository.  For release versions of this software, please see releases (e.g. ORCA-public).  This repository contains code for various chromatin analysis processes written in the Boettiger lab, including ChrTracer.  

## Side projects
* Replacement for Insight3 as a quick viewer.  Add additional features including:
    - max-projection
    - split frame by interval (to separate data from different channels taken with shutters files)
    
* Correct hot pixels 
    - see FixHotPixels.m for a start
    - needs more data and more testing
    - maybe it should start with the whole field and read the ini file to camera view field and clip from there.
    
* automatic control-point based registration
