## Overview
- This repository contains a library of functions I find useful in my daily research.  
- This repository is also only intended at present for my personal use and that of my collaborators.  It is not a public repository. Stable releases of specific projects may contain substantial portions of this library.
- The boettiger lab uses a branch of this repository for our day-to-day research activities, which is updated from here.

### organization
* most new functions are saved in `ChrTracingLib`.  Having all the functions in one place makes them easier to find and search, and not create redundant or nearly redundant functions as part of separate parallel projects.
* some functions that clearly have specialized applications (NextGenSeq, qPCR, BLAST) have their own folders still.
