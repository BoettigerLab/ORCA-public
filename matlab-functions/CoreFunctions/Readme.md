## CoreFunctions
This folder contains core routines that are used by all Boettiger Lab custom functions to handle variable arguments.

This folder also contains the overloaded uiopen, which allows matlab to recognized filetypes by drag-and-drop.  

The scheme for handling variable arguments used here was originally developed by Jeff Moffitt in collaboration with Alistair Boettiger.
